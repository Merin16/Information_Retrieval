      "spain s hopes of winning a second world cup trophy in qatar lie in the hands and feet of goalkeeper unai simon luis enrique s possession based system demands a goalkeeper brave enough to distribute to nearby team mates even when under immense pressure from opposition forwards sometimes it goes woefully wrong but the coach has kept his faith in simon no matter the criticism received after errors simon survived scares against germany in the group stage draw while he was at fault for japan s first goal in their shock win over spain on thursday with spain losing for a few minutes la roja were due to be eliminated they dodged that bullet when germany triumphed progressing in second place from group e to set up tuesday s last clash with morocco japan laid the blueprint for the north african nation to follow with spain malfunctioning completely when the samurai blue overloaded their system they scored two against us and if they had needed two more then they would have scored them too i m sure said coach luis enrique after the game sponsored by vuuklewith spain up and cruising against japan at the start of the second half simon played the ball out to alejandro balde who was immediately pressed and lost possession ritsu doan drove the loose ball past simon at his near post from the edge of the box simon got a hand on it and might have kept it out with some claiming manchester united goalkeeper david de gea would have saved the shot itv pundit gary neville claimed simon seemed a real weak point for la roja later advocating for de gea however he was never likely to be selected with luis enrique bringing david raya from brentford and robert sanchez of brighton as simon s back ups two goalkeepers more comfortable with the ball at their feet and who create fewer headlines they will have low expectations of featuring with luis enrique making it clear that the year old is his no if unai didn t play well with his feet he couldn t be the goalkeeper of the national team said luis enrique after spain s draw with germany unai simon has everything spain s goalkeeper needs comfortableluis enrique says when simon errs it does not worry him as long as he is carrying out the plan set for him the coach s explanations won over the athletic bilbao stopper who emerged after kepa arrizabalaga left for chelsea for a world record million pound million euro fee for a goalkeeper he established himself in with athletic making his spain debut a year later and being selected at euro against croatia simon let pedri s back pass slip past his foot for a spectacular own goal but redeemed himself with penalty saves against switzerland in the quarter finals unfortunately for spain he could not repeat the trick against italy in the semis and the azzurri progressed keeping hold of the no jersey through that tournament ensured simon bought further into luis enrique s way of playing for me it s not a risk said simon ahead of the japan clash this national team has known how to solve these situations multiple times and that s how it will be that s the idea that the coach wants and he s convinced me of it and i am comfortable with it luis enrique hinted his team might work on being a little more pragmatic with longer passes accepting the japan loss as a warning if against morocco we have the fortune to go in front morocco will risk it all at full pelt again said the coach this has to serve as a warning that this is going to happen then again given the coach s belief in his system he may even ask simon to double down on the existing strategy it could generate a tense situation and the pressure will keep increasing in the knock out games added simon listen to the latest songs only on jiosaavn com this is how the national team plays i ve got used to

      "spain s hopes of winning a second world cup trophy in qatar lie in the hands and feet of goalkeeper unai simon luis enrique s possession based system demands a goalkeeper brave enough to distribute to nearby team mates even when under immense pressure from opposition forwards sometimes it goes woefully wrong but the coach has kept his faith in simon no matter the criticism received after errors simon survived scares against germany in the group stage draw while he was at fault for japan s first goal in their shock win over spain on thursday with spain losing for a few minutes la roja were due to be eliminated they dodged that bullet when germany triumphed progressing in second place from group e to set up tuesday s last clash with morocco japan laid the blueprint for the north african nation to follow with spain malfunctioning completely when the samurai blue overloaded their system they scored two against us and if they had needed two more then they would have scored them too i m sure said coach luis enrique after the game sponsored by vuuklewith spain up and cruising against japan at the start of the second half simon played the ball out to alejandro balde who was immediately pressed and lost possession ritsu doan drove the loose ball past simon at his near post from the edge of the box simon got a hand on it and might have kept it out with some claiming manchester united goalkeeper david de gea would have saved the shot itv pundit gary neville claimed simon seemed a real weak point for la roja later advocating for de gea however he was never likely to be selected with luis enrique bringing david raya from brentford and robert sanchez of brighton as simon s back ups two goalkeepers more comfortable with the ball at their feet and who create fewer headlines they will have low expectations of featuring with luis enrique making it clear that the year old is his no if unai didn t play well with his feet he couldn t be the goalkeeper of the national team said luis enrique after spain s draw with germany unai simon has everything spain s goalkeeper needs comfortableluis enrique says when simon errs it does not worry him as long as he is carrying out the plan set for him the coach s explanations won over the athletic bilbao stopper who emerged after kepa arrizabalaga left for chelsea for a world record million pound million euro fee for a goalkeeper he established himself in with athletic making his spain debut a year later and being selected at euro against croatia simon let pedri s back pass slip past his foot for a spectacular own goal but redeemed himself with penalty saves against switzerland in the quarter finals unfortunately for spain he could not repeat the trick against italy in the semis and the azzurri progressed keeping hold of the no jersey through that tournament ensured simon bought further into luis enrique s way of playing for me it s not a risk said simon ahead of the japan clash this national team has known how to solve these situations multiple times and that s how it will be that s the idea that the coach wants and he s convinced me of it and i am comfortable with it luis enrique hinted his team might work on being a little more pragmatic with longer passes accepting the japan loss as a warning if against morocco we have the fortune to go in front morocco will risk it all at full pelt again said the coach this has to serve as a warning that this is going to happen then again given the coach s belief in his system he may even ask simon to double down on the existing strategy it could generate a tense situation and the pressure will keep increasing in the knock out games added simon listen to the latest songs only on jiosaavn com this is how the national team plays i ve got used to

      "olivier giroud was an integral part of france s world cup winning side but in qatar the striker has brought the goals missing from his game four years ago in russia on a night when the insatiable kylian mbappe scored two brilliant goals giroud wrote himself into the history books with his nd goal for les bleus eclipsing thierry s henry all time record in a last tie billed as mbappe against robert lewandowski it was the evergreen year old giroud who set france on their way to a win with the opening goal just before half time olivier has always been an important player even if four years ago with the title he didn t score he was always important said france coach didier deschamps he has had difficult periods today he is rewarded because he has often been criticised it is not just any old record beyond it being thierry henry he has beaten to score so many international goals he was there before i even became coach so bravo to him and to his teammates who have helped him score so many goals with favourites brazil sweating over the fitness of neymar heading into their last tie and argentina s hopes heavily pinned on lionel messi the france attack looks built to last the course of a breakneck tournament sponsored by vuukledeschamps caught flak for fielding a misshapen france side that resulted in a disjointed performance against tunisia with qualification already assured but he felt it a gamble worthwhile to keep his key players fresh in sapping conditions in a competition where as france learned the hard way at euro it can be all over with one brief dip record breaking moment france had to be patient against a poland side which as expected defended deep and in numbers but once mbappe s sublime ball through played in giroud to steer past wojciech szczensy there was only really one outcome giroud s career has been defined by silencing his detractors and on sunday he surpassed henry s mark which had stood since to become his country s top goalscorer on his th appearance olivier is a great leader a great example for the young generation said france captain hugo lloris in your career it doesn t matter if you have ups and downs the most important is to stay consistent to stay strong in your mind in important moments and to never give up this is something olivier did during his career and he s rewarded he for sure doesn t want to stay on this number he wants to add a few more giroud s goal lit the fuse for a france frontline which delivered the knockout blow with minutes to play mbappe administering a brutal finish from just inside the box the game poland s first in the world cup knockout rounds since was up but mbappe wasn t done smashing in a third in stoppage time while mbappe made it nine goals in world cup games and in
